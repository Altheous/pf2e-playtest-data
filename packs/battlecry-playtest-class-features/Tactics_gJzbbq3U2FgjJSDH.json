      "value": "<p>By studying and practicing the strategic arts of war, you can guide your allies to victory. You begin play with a folio containing four tactics. These are combat techniques and coordinated maneuvers you can instruct your allies in, enabling them to respond to your signals in combat. As you increase in level, you gain the ability to learn more potent tactics. When you gain the expert tactician class feature, you gain the ability to add expert tactics to your folio, when you gain the master tactician class feature you can add master tactics to your folio, and when you gain the legendary tactician class feature you can add legendary tactics to your folio.</p>\n<h2>Preparing and Changing Tactics</h2>\n<p>Each day during your daily preparations, you prepare two tactics from your folio and drill in them alongside your allies, enabling you to use these tactics until your next daily preparations. When you drill, you can instruct a total number of allies equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier, enabling these allies to respond to your tactics in combat; these allies are referred to as your squadmates. A squadmate always has the option not to respond to your tactical signal if they do not wish to. You can change which tactics you have prepared from those in your folio by spending 10 minutes to drill, replacing all previously prepared tactics and allies. This does not prevent your allies from performing their own activities during this time frame.</p>\n<h2>Gaining New Tactics</h2>\n<p>You add additional tactics to your folio and increase the number of tactics you can prepare when you gain the expert tactician, master tactician, and legendary tactician class features. You can also add tactics to your folio with the Tactical Expansion feat though this does not change the number you can have prepared. Because tactics folios use shorthand and signals unique to each commander, there is typically no benefit to using (or stealing) another commander's folio, though you can train with another commander to retrain one tactic in your folio to another that they know (if the tactic required a class feat to learn, you must retrain a class feat of at least that level to learn it, as normal).</p>"
