You start play with a custom banner that you can use to signal allies when using tactics (see below) or to deploy specific abilities. Your banner can be affixed to a weapon or shield you are wielding, or held in one hand and attached to a simple pole. Feats and abilities with the banner trait require you to be holding your banner or wielding a weapon or shield it is attached to.</p>\n<p>As long as your banner is visible (such as by being affixed to your weapon or worn attached to a pole alongside your backpack), you and all allies in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30] gain a +1 status bonus to Will saves and DCs against fear effects. You pause or resume this effect as part of any action you would typically use to stow or retrieve your banner, such as Interacting to stow it. If your banner is destroyed or stolen, allies within 30 feet become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 1}. This effect has the aura, commander, emotion, mental, and visual traits.</p>\n<p>Some abilities allow you to place your banner in a specialized manner; as long as you have placed your banner in this way, any banner abilities originate from your banner's space instead of your own.</p>"
