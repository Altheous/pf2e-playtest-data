Make a melee Strike. If it hits, you deal an additional @Damage[2d6[piercing]] damage. This additional damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This Strike counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty. Your armor then gains the broken condition; while your armor is broken, you don't take its penalty to Speed and if your armor has the bulwark trait, you retain that bonus to Reflex saves, though the bonus is decreased by 1.</p>"
