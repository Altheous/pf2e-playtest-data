Each time you would Strike an ally due to being @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} or controlled, you can attempt another saving throw against the effect that caused you to be confused or controlled with a +4 circumstance bonus to the save; failing or critically failing this additional save doesn't increase the effect's duration. If you would end the condition due to this save, you don't make the Strike and you can take any remaining actions during your turn as normal.</p>"
