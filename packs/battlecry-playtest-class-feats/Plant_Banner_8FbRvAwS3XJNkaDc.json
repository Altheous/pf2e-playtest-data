      "value": "<p>You plant your banner to inspire your allies to hold the line. Plant your banner in a corner of your square. All allies within a @Template[type:burst|distance:30] immediately gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half your Intelligence modifier. These temporary Hit Points last for 1 round; each time an ally starts their turn within the burst, these Hit Points are renewed for another round. While your banner is planted, you can signal your tactics abilities only with auditory signals (instead of your choice of auditory or visual). If your banner is attached to a weapon, you cannot wield that weapon while your banner is planted. While your banner is planted, any effects that normally happen in an emanation around your banner instead happen in a burst that is 10 feet larger (so a @Template[type:emanation|distance:30] becomes a @Template[type:burst|distance:40]).</p>\n<p>You can use this action again while adjacent to your banner to retrieve it. An enemy adjacent to the square you planted your banner in can remove your banner as an Interact action, ending this effect and preventing you and your allies from gaining any of your banner's other benefits until you have successfully retrieved it.</p>\n<p>If you are at least 5th level, the temporary Hit Points granted by this ability are instead equal to your Intelligence modifier, and if you are at least 15th level, they are equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>"
