Attempt a @Check[type:medicine|dc:40] check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.IkGYwHRLhkuoGReG]{Raise Dead}, except it still has the wounded condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Desperate Resuscitation for 1 day.</p>"
