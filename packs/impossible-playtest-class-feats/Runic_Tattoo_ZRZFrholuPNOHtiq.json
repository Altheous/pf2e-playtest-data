The rune is always etched on your body and doesn't count toward your maximum limit of etched runes. You can invoke this rune like any of your other runes, but once invoked, the rune fades significantly and is drained of power until your next daily preparations.</p><p>You can magically alter your runic tattoo to change it to another rune you know (or remove it altogether) with a week of downtime.</p>"
