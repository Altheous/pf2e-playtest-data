You can use Performance instead of Crafting when attempting Crafting checks related to runes. Once per minute, you can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-playtest-data.impossible-playtest-actions.Item.wamCImlN6xwUHzyk]{Trace a Rune} with song alone, removing the need to have a free hand, removing the manipulate trait from Trace Rune, and allowing you to use the 2-action version of Trace Rune as a single action. You don't need to be able to move your hands when Tracing a Rune using song, but you do need to be able to sing in a clear voice.</p>"
