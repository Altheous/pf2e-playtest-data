If this weapon requires ammunition, mundane bone ammunition is created when you reload it. You can have only one weapon created this way at a time; if you create another, the original falls apart. If you are not holding the weapon at the end of your turn, the weapon falls apart. The weapon improves to a <em>+2 striking</em> weapon if you're 10th level, a <em>+2 greater striking</em> weapon at 12th level, a <em>+3 greater striking</em> weapon at 16th level, or a <em>+3 major striking</em> weapon at 19th level.</p><p>You can destroy an adjacent thrall as part of using this action. If you do, the weapon also gains a <em>decaying</em> rune, or the <em>greater decaying</em> rune if you're 15th level or higher.</p>"
