Attempt a @Check[crafting] check against a standard DC of the target creature's level. Regardless of the outcome, you cannot attempt to use By Your Name against the target again for 24 hours.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You understand the target's true name, which you add temporarily to your runic repertoire as a special diacritic rune. This diacritic rune magnifies the effects of the base rune when targeting the creature whose true name the rune represents. When invoked, the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty on their saving throw against the effects of the base rune. Additionally, if the base rune deals damage, it gains a status bonus to its damage equal to half your level. The inspiration used to understand this diacritic rune fades quickly, and you forget how to use the diacritic rune after 1 minute.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but a –1 penalty and the rune doesn't magnify damage.</p>"
