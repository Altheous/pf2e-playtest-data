For the next minute, when you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-playtest-data.impossible-playtest-actions.Item.wamCImlN6xwUHzyk]{Trace a Rune} and the target is that creature, you can do so at a range of 60 feet as a single action. Using Drawn in Red against a different creature requires you to wipe off or otherwise discard the blood used for the previous creature, which you can do as a free action.</p>"
