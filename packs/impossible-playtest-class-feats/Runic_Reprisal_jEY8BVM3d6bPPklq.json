When you use Fortifying Knock, you can trace a damaging rune on your shield, even if it could not normally be applied to a shield. The traced rune doesn't have its normal effect, instead fading into your shield. If you Shield Block with the shield against an adjacent target, you can Invoke the Rune as part of the reaction, causing the rune to detonate outwards and apply its invocation effect to the attacking creature.</p>"
