In addition to the runes' normal effects, a chain of glowing script flows between them, dealing @Damage[((floor(@actor.level/2))d6)[force]|options:area-damage] damage to all creatures in the line, but not the rune-bearers. Creatures can attempt a @Check[reflex|against:runesmith|basic|options:area-effect] saving throw; on a critical failure, they are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained} as the runes seal their movements until the end of your next turn or until they @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escape}.
