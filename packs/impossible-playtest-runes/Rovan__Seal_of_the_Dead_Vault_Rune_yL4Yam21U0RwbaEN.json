The rune-bearer takes a –20-foot penalty to its land Speed and a –40-foot penalty to all other Speeds as the rune attempts to bind the creature. If a creature's fly Speed is reduced to 0 this way, it can't take the Fly or Arrest a Fall action.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-playtest-data.impossible-playtest-effects.Item.CJe2eWiKHOgv90j4]{Effect: Rovan, Seal of the Dead Vault Rune}</p><p><strong>Invocation</strong> (earth, incapacitation) The ground in a 10-foot emanation around the rune-bearer becomes difficult terrain permanently, and the rune-bearer must attempt a @Check[fortitude|against:runesmith|traits:earth,incapacitation] saving throw as the earth around it attempts to surround and imprison it. The rune-bearer is then immune to your <em>rovan, seal of the dead vault</em> runes for 24 hours.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The bearer is unaffected.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> The bearer becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for 1 round.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> The bearer becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2} for 1 round.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The bearer becomes slowed 2, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained}, and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} as it becomes trapped in a massive, compressed sphere of earth. If the bearer is unable to escape the sphere within 3 rounds, it becomes petrified. Over the course of a year, the sphere forms a small hill around it, hiding its buried prisoner. At the top of the hill, a stone with the image of this rune remains. Counteracting the stone frees the prisoner.</p>"
