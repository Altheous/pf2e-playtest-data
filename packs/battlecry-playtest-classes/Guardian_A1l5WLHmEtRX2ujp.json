      "value": "<p><em>You are the shield, the steel wall that holds back the tide of deadly force exhibited by enemies great and small. You are clad in armor that you wear like a second skin. You can angle your armor to protect yourself and your allies from damage and keep foes at bay. You also make yourself a more tempting target to take the hits that might have otherwise struck down your companions.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Key Ability: STRENGTH</strong></p>\n<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Strength.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>\n<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Roleplaying the Guardian</h1>\n<h2>During combat encounters...</h2>\n<p>You are unparalleled in your use of armor, squeezing every last drop of protection it offers. You stay close to your most vulnerable allies, taking the hits that target them. You can also taunt your foes, drawing their ire and attention so they attack you instead of others.</p>\n<h2>During social encounters...</h2>\n<p>Depending on your background, you might be friendly or coercive during negotiations. You usually feel more comfortable on the field of battle when you can more easily tell friend from foe, but that doesn't mean you can't bond with other soldiers or those who have had experiences similar to yours.</p>\n<h2>While exploring...</h2>\n<p>You remain vigilant against possible threats, ready to step up at a moment's notice to guard your allies. Constantly wearing armor has made you stronger, allowing you to surmount physical challenges such as moving heavy objects or scaling walls.</p>\n<h2>In downtime...</h2>\n<p>Your armor and shield might have gotten damaged during your latest adventures, so you often spend time repairing and maintaining them. You might also earn some extra coin doing manual labor or extra work as a town guard.</p>\n<h2>You might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Stand firm in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, trusting in the strength of your armor to pull you through.</li>\n<li>Good-naturedly joke about how the damage you’ve taken has effectively saved the lives of your companions.</li>\n<li>Be slow to trust the motives of anyone who isn’t one of your allies, assuming they mean to do you harm.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate the sturdiness of your armor, especially when it absorbs an attack meant for them.</li>\n<li>Don’t understand why you’d want to put yourself in danger by taunting enemies.</li>\n<li>Feel safer when you are standing beside them on the field of battle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.</p>\n<h2>Perception</h2>\n<p>Trained in Perception</p>\n<h2>Saving Throws</h2>\n<p>Expert in Fortitude</p>\n<p>Trained in Reflex</p>\n<p>Expert in Will</p>\n<h2>Skills</h2>\n<p>Trained in Athletics</p>\n<p>Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 3 plus your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h2>Attacks</h2>\n<p>Trained in martial weapons</p>\n<p>Trained in simple weapons</p>\n<p>Trained in unarmed attacks</p>\n<h2>Defenses</h2>\n<p>Trained in all armors</p>\n<p>Trained in unarmored defense</p>\n<h2>Class DC</h2>\n<p>Trained in guardian class DC</p>\n<h2>Class Features</h2>\n<p>You gain these abilities as an guardian.

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. </p>\n<h2>Guardian Armor</h2>\n<p>Even when you are struck, your armor protects you from some harm. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor. In addition, you can rest normally while wearing medium and heavy armor.</p>\n<h2>Guardian Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an guardian class feat.</p>\n<h2>Intercept Strike</h2>\n<p>You keep your charges safe from harm, even if it means you get hurt yourself. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-playtest-data.battlecry-playtest-actions.Item.nlwUZT357CKxrA8L]{Intercept Strike} reaction.</p>\n<h2>Shield Block</h2>\n<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block} general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>\n<h2>Taunt</h2>\n<p>Often, the best way to protect your allies is to have the enemy want to attack you instead. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-playtest-data.battlecry-playtest-actions.Item.DgpbozZor19Wytfm]{Taunt}action.</p>\n<h2>Threat Technique</h2>\n<p>Whether you stop their worst attacks or strike them down for going after your allies, you know how to deal with the targets of your taunts. Choose ferocious vengeance or mitigate harm.</p>\n<p><strong>Ferocious Vengeance</strong>: Enemies that ignore your taunts take the brunt of your anger. You deal 2 additional damage on Strikes against creatures affected by your Taunt if they take a hostile action that doesn't include you as a target. This bonus lasts until the end of your turn. This additional damage increases by 2 at 9th level and 16th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitigate Harm</strong>: You gain resistance to damage from critical hits made by a creature affected by your Taunt. This resistance is equal to 2 + half your level; this resistance increases by 2 at 5th level, 11th level, and 15th level.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">2nd</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. </p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">3rd</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">3rd</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Tough to Kill<span style=\"float:right\">3rd</span></h2>\n<p>The protectiveness of your armor ensures that even if you fall, you take longer to die. You gain the Diehard general feat. If you already have the Diehard feat, you can retrain it when you get tough to kill. The first time each day you'd be reduced to dying 3 or higher, you stay at dying 2 instead.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">5th</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Armor Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">5th</span></h2>\n<p>With training, you understand how to best block hits with your armor. Your proficiency rank with medium armor and heavy armor increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Reflex Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">5th</span></h2>\n<p>Even in the heaviest of armors, you can brace yourself against widespread effects. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Reaction Time<span style=\"float:right\">7th</span></h2>\n<p>You are always on the lookout for danger and can react to it in an instant. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. In addition, you gain a reaction whenever you roll initiative for combat, but you can use only for reactions from guardian feats or class features.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">7th</span></h2>\n<p>Sometimes, the best defense is a good offense. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Battle Hardened<span style=\"float:right\">9th</span></h2>\n<p>Your experience in battle helps protect you against magic and toxins alike. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Guardian Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">9th</span></h2>\n<p>Your armored form is more imposing. Your proficiency rank for your guardian class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">11th</span></h2>\n<p>When clad in steel, you fend off most attacks. Your proficiency rank with medium armor and heavy armor increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">11th</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Greater Armor Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">13th</span></h2>\n<p>When enforced with runes, your armor turns aside weaker blows. Double the value of your armor's potency rune when calculating the resistance gained from armor specialization.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Armor<span style=\"float:right\">15th</span></h2>\n<p>You have become an almost impenetrable bulwark. Your proficiency ranks for medium and heavy armor increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Unyielding Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">15th</span></h2>\n<p>Like the armor you wear, you refuse to break. Your proficiency ranks for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">17th</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">17th</span></h2>\n<p>Your hours of battlefield experience grant you greater prowess. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Guardian Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">19th</span></h2>\n<p>You are known for your suit of armor more than the person inside. Your proficiency rank for your guardian class DC increases to master. When you attempt a Reflex save to avoid a damaging effect, such as a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.sxQZ6yqTn0czJxVd]{Fireball}</em>, you add your armor's item bonus to AC instead of your Dexterity modifier. If you get a success when you do this, you get a critical success instead.</p>"
