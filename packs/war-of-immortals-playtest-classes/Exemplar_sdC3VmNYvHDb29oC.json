Somehow, a fragment of divinity rests within your body, granting you abilities that reach into the realm previously reserved for heroes and legends. What you do with your nascent godhood is yours to decide, but whether you cultivate your power to become a hero or you turn this authority to selfish ends, your name will be carved in history forever, immortalized in the memory of gods and mortals alike.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Key Attribute: STRENGTH OR DEXTERITY</strong></p>\n<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>\n<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Roleplaying the Exemplar</h1>\n<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You fight on the vanguard, scattering lesser foes to the winds. You concentrate your divine energy into the right weapon or tool for the moment. When an arrow strikes your skin, it stings no more than a flea; when your spear strikes forward, it can pierce gods.</p>\n<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You naturally cut a larger-than-life figure. You may use your personal magnetism to inspire others, or you might be a lone and brooding figure who speaks only seldom. Either way, your actions and words hang in the air with weight.</p>\n<h2>While Exploring...</h2>\n<p>You feel for the flow of fate, knowing that your path will bring you to your next quest.</p>\n<h2>In Downtime...</h2>\n<p>Inactivity rarely suits an exemplar, so you seek out additional deeds or quests to spread your name. You might search for creatures to slay, compete in athletic contests, or quest for lost artifacts.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Chase glory across the land, beyond the sea, and over the horizon.</li>\n<li>Take other heroes under your wing, that your legend may live on through them.</li>\n<li>Feel the weight of immense expectations and obligation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Look to you in times of crisis, thinking you can handle any challenge.</li>\n<li>Think of you as larger than life, the nexus of any grand tale.</li>\n<li>Mistake your heroism and capability for pride and aloofness.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Divine Spark and Ikons</h2>\n<p>Within your soul is a tiny spark of divine power that belongs not to a deity but something all your own. You can manifest this divine power through special items known as ikons. Ikons are items intrinsically linked to you—sacred vessels crystallized from your divinity that are capable of legendary feats in your hands. There are three types of ikons: body ikons are a mark on your flesh that shows you as more than mortal, worn ikons are sacred clothing or other raiment, and weapon ikons let you carve your story onto the world. Choose three ikons, one of each type. Your body takes on the qualities of your chosen body ikon, and you gain non-magical, level-0 items of your choice that satisfy the requirements for your chosen worn ikon and weapon ikon. Providence ensures you come across these items; you might be traveling along a path to find a spear in a tree that only you can dislodge, or you might awaken holding a gleaming sash you saw in your dreams.</p>\n<p>By focusing your divine spark into one of your ikons, you empower that ikon to accomplish deeds beyond what it could in mortal hands. As long as your divine spark resides in an ikon, you gain that ikon's immanence effect. You can call your spark forth and place it into an ikon by using the Shift Immanence action.</p>\n<p>Shift Immanence <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span></p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round You shift the focus of your divinity, filling one of your ikons with your divine spark. That ikon softly glows with radiant light, emits subtle chimes as it moves, or is otherwise obviously empowered in a way that matches your growing divinity, granting the ikon the divine trait and granting you that ikon's immanence effects for as long as your divine spark is empowering it. Your spark is indivisible, so it can empower only one ikon at a time. You can also Shift Immanence to return your spark to the depths of your soul, leaving none of your ikons empowered.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> In addition to the above usage, you can also Shift Immanence as a free action triggered when you roll initiative.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While your spark dwells within an ikon, you are also able to channel your divinity through the ikon in a powerful transcendence ability—though the force of this act will temporarily cast your divine spark out of the ikon.</p>\n<p>Spark Transcendence <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span></p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The ikon must currently house your divine spark. You can unleash an ikon's transcendence ability only if you are holding it (if it's a weapon ikon) or wearing it (if it's a worn ikon).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You channel the full might of your divine spark through your ikon to briefly surpass mortal limitations and enact a miraculous deed. This is a special activity that takes a variable number of actions, as listed in the ikon's stat block. Some ikons are activated as a free action or reaction instead of as an activity. Immediately after the effects of the transcendence resolve, your divine spark is forcefully ejected from that ikon into another ikon of your choice.</p>\n<h2>Humble Strikes</h2>\n<p>Even the most unassuming weapons can accomplish heroic deeds in your hands. When you are wielding a simple weapon, increase the damage die size of that weapon by one step.</p>\n<h2>Exemplar Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain an exemplar class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Root Epithet<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>When your divine spark bonded with your soul, it became dyed in your personality and qualities. As your deeds give shape to this nascent divinity, you come to bear an epithet—a word or phrase that reflects your story and that others come to call you by. Your epithets each affect one of your ikons, granting it additional capacities.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you gain a root epithet, which describes the core of your personality and affects the qualities of your body ikon. If you are already trained in the granted skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice, as normal. Choose one epithet from the list below.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Spirit Striking<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Your power can't be contained, escaping in sparks and embers through your weapons as you wreak violence. You deal 2 additional spirit damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Dominion Epithet <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your divinity has grown in power along with your deeds, allowing you to begin claiming dominion over aspects usually reserved for the gods. Choose one of the following epithets, which affect your weapon ikon.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Divine Premonition<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>A sense of the flow of fate allows you to respond to danger with uncanny alacrity. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Godly Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your ability to wield your divine power effectively increases. Your proficiency rank for your exemplar class DC increases to expert. If you have domain spells, your proficiency rank for spell attacks and spell DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Divine Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with weapons is divinely inspired. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure at a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Greater Spirit Striking<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your additional damage from spirit striking increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Sovereignty Epithet<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The litany of heroic deeds left in your wake has caused your divine spark to grow in power, bright enough that it now illuminates your legacy. Choose one of the following epithets, which affect your worn ikon.</p>\n<h2>Deific Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You have achieved mastery over the divine power that flows through you. Your proficiency rank for your exemplar class DC increases to master. If you have domain spells, your proficiency rank for spell attacks and spell DC increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Mastery <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.</p>"
