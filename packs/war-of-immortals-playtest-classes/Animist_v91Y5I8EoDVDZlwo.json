You mix your own divine magic and the myriad spells granted to you by your attuned apparitions to cast down your enemies, sustain your allies, detect hidden threats, and lessen harmful effects.</p>\n<h2>During social encounters...</h2>\n<p> You watch and listen, letting the whispers of spirits and otherworldly beings guide you towards sound judgment. You may call upon the wisdom of an apparition particularly attuned to the issue at hand, relying on its expertise where your own falls short.</p>\n<h2>While exploring...</h2>\n<p>You use your patient attention to detail, alongside clues and special senses gifted to you by your spiritual allies, to detect threats before they can ambush your companions or notice hidden treasures that others might pass by.</p>\n<h2>In downtime...</h2>\n<p>You seek out areas close to otherworldly entities who bring you strength or comfort. You might tend to grave sites, tread primeval wildernesses, or ride the rivers and seas. Animists attuned to apparitions of wisdom and knowledge may spend their quiet hours in libraries or temples, conversing on simple and complex topics alike with fellow scholars both seen and unseen.</p>\n<h2>You might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Talk to spiritual entities only you can perceive.</li>\n<li>Prefer to speak in stories and descriptive anecdotes.</li>\n<li>Look at the world from a broader or more metaphorical perspective than most mortal creatures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Find you detached or absent-minded due to your focus on things beyond their awareness.</li>\n<li>Mistake you for being cruel or lacking empathy because you give equal weight to the material and immaterial.</li>\n<li>Value your wisdom as someone with access to vast troves of experience beyond what a single person could normally accumulate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Apparition Attunement Animists gain their power by serving as a bridge for spiritual entities—known collectively as apparitions—to commune and interact with the physical world in a process called attunement. Apparitions are myriad and diverse: they may be human spirits lingering on the border between becoming phantoms or ghosts, animal spirits with particularly strong connections to the physical world but lacking the malice that would spur a transition into true undeath, manifestations of natural locations grown thought and purpose over time, or a variety of other such entities. Some animists attune to one or more specific apparitions that accompany them in their travels, forming a deep partnership over time, while others adapt to their surroundings by befriending the local apparitions who dwell wherever the animist's journey takes them.</p>\n<p>Each day during your daily preparations, choose two apparitions from the list below to attune to. Of these, choose one to be your primary apparition. Your attuned apparitions each grant you knowledge in the form of Lore skills and a repertoire of additional spells you can cast using apparition spellcasting (see below), and your primary apparition grants you even further power in the form a unique vessel focus spell and, when you are higher level, a unique avatar form.</p>\n<p>When you Refocus, you can change which of your currently attuned apparitions is your primary apparition, selecting from any of the apparitions you attuned to during your daily preparations. All your apparitions typically remain attuned to you until your next daily preparations, but some animist abilities can temporarily disperse them, usually in exchange for a powerful boon. If an apparition is dispersed, you lose access to its gifts-you forget its apparition skills, its spells are removed from your apparition spell repertoire, and you cannot use its vessel spell or avatar form-until you attune to it again. When you disperse your primary apparition, your remaining apparition becomes your primary apparition.</p>\n<h2>Animist and Apparition Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your role as a spiritual medium connecting the mortal Universe to the realms beyond lets you cast your magic in two distinct ways. You both learn and prepare spells from the divine tradition yourself, and you also channel the knowledge and power of your attuned apparitions, gaining spell slots and a repertoire of spells from them that you can cast spontaneously.</p>\n<p>Regardless of which source you're drawing on, you are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the divine tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As an animist, your incantations might be reciting relevant snippets of legends-stories passed down orally-or they might see you calling nearby spirits to honor ancient vows; your gestures could take the form of elegant dances or full-body convulsions as generations of memories and otherworldly energies surge through you.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifiers and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>The clearly delineated partnership between an animist and their apparitions means you can't cast your animist spells using your apparition spell slots or vice versa; your magics remain complementary and harmonious, yet as distinct as the two worlds from which they come.</p>\n<h3>Animist Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>As a keeper of knowledge, you are constantly learning new tales and spells. Each day, you can prepare one 1strank spell and two cantrips from among the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as an animist, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Animist Spells per Day table.</p>\n<h3>Apparition Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>You can draw upon your attuned apparitions as a second source of magical knowledge and power. You gain additional spell slots and a spell repertoire from your attuned apparitions. At first level, you can cast one 1strank apparition spell per day. You must have the spell in your apparition spell repertoire to cast it; this is a collection of spells granted to you by all of your attuned apparitions. Any of these spells that aren't normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you cast them this way. As you increase in level, you gain further apparition spell slots, and your apparitions grant you higher-rank apparition spells, as detailed in each apparition entry.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you gain spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<p>The spirits are not so limited in their magic as mortal spellcasters. All of your apparition spells are signature spells. That means that you can heighten an apparition spell freely by casting it from a higher-rank apparition spell slot, up to the maximum rank of apparition spell you can cast.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of animist spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level animist, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level animist, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h3>Vessel Spells</h3>\n<p>Your primary attuned apparition can use your body as a conduit, allowing you to cast a unique vessel spell. Vessel spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to treat with nearby spirits, meditate on resolving an issue pertaining to the balance of spirits and mortals, or telling a story.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>1+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>1+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2+3</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2+3</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>1+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>2+3</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>2+3</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>1+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>2+3</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>2+3</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>1+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>2+3</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>2+3</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>1+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>2+4</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>2+4</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>1+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>2+4</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>2+4</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>1+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>2+4</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>2+4</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>1+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>2+4</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>2+4</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>0+1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>2+4</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+2</td>\n<td>2+1</td>\n<td>0+1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">\n<p>The number before a plus sign indicates your spell slots via animist spellcasting, and the number after it your spell slots from apparition spellcasting.
