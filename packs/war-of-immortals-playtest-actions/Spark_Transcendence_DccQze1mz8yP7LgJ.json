You can unleash an ikon's transcendence ability only if you are holding it (if it's a weapon ikon) or wearing it (if it's a worn ikon).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You channel the full might of your divine spark through your ikon to briefly surpass mortal limitations and enact a miraculous deed. This is a special activity that takes a variable number of actions, as listed in the ikon's stat block. Some ikons are activated as a free action or reaction instead of as an activity. Immediately after the effects of the transcendence resolve, your divine spark is forcefully ejected from that ikon into another ikon of your choice.</p>\n<p>Â </p>"
