As long as that enemy remains within your worn ikon's aura, it deals an additional @Damage[10[spirit]] damage to you with each successful Strike or spell it targets you with. Whenever it deals spirit damage to you, each ally within the aura can attempt a Reactive Strike against it, even if they do not normally have that reaction. If an ally within your aura successfully slays the enemy with a Reactive Strike, they immediately gain temporary Hit Points equal to their level, which persist for 1 minute.</p>"
