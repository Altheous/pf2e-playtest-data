The Strike deals an additional @Damage[3d8[spirit],3d8[negative]]{3d8 spirit damage and 3d8 void} damage. If the creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it's immediately killed: not in the present, but in the recent past. This temporal destruction erases the consequences of their recent actions; if a creature died within the last round as a result of the incinerated target's actions, that creature is returned to life with [[/r 5d8[healing]]] Hit Points at the location that it died as its death is retroactively undone.</p>"
