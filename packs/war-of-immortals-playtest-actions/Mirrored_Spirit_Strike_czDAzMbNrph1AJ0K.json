If the Strikes are made with a weapon that doesn't have the agile trait, the second Strike takes a â€“2 penalty. If both attacks hit, you combine their damage, which is all dealt as spirit damage. You add any precision damage only once. Combine the damage from both Strikes and apply resistances and weaknesses only once. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.</p>"
