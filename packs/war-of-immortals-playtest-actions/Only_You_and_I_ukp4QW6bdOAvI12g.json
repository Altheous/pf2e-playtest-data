Until the end of your next turn, that enemy gains a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls it makes against you, but it must attempt a Will save whenever it tries to move away from you, Strike a target other than you, or Cast a Spell that doesn't include you as a target. On a failure, the target loses the action or actions related to the failed attempt. Whenever the enemy misses you with a Strike while this effect is active, you heal [[/r (1d8+5)[healing]]] Hit Points.</p>"
