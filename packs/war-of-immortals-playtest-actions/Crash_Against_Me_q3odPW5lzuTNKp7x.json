During this time, if a creature fails a melee attack roll against you using a weapon dealing the same damage type as your resistance, or if they succeed at an attack against you with the weapon but your resistance would be enough to reduce the damage dealt to 0, that weapon clangs wildly off your skin with a painful reverberation, making the attacking enemy @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Off-Guard]{Off-Guard} and applying a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attacks with that weapon until the beginning of their next turn.</p>"
