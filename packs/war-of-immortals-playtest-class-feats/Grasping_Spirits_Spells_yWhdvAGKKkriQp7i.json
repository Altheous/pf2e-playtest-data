If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has a range and targets one creature, you can choose one target for the spell that is up to 30 feet out of the spell's normal range. Your apparitions briefly take on semi-physical forms and attempt to drag the target into range of the spell. The target must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.spellDC.value)] saving throw against your spell DC; on a failure, it is pulled up to 30 feet directly toward you, and then affected by the spell as normal. You don't need to pull the target the full 30 feet, but you must pull it to within the spell's normal range. If the target succeeds at its save to resist this forced movement, the actions used to Cast the Spell are wasted, but your apparition is able to conserve and cycle the magical energies back to you, so you retain any Focus Points or spell slots used to Cast the Spell.</p>"
