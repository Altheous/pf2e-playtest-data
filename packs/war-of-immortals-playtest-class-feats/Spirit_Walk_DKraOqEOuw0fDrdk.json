While Searching or Detecting Magic in exploration mode, you and up to 4 allies within 30 feet don't trigger reactions from haunts and spirits. Your apparition sight is now a precise sense, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge checks related to any entities you can detect with your apparition sight. After rolling initiative, you and each ally within range of your apparition sight gain resistance equal to half your level against damage dealt by haunts or spirits until the end of your first turn.</p>"
