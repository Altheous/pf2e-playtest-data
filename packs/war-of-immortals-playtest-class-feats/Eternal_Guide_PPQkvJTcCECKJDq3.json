      "value": "<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per week</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The spirits who guide you carry your soul back to the community you call home. Choose a single settlement with a population of at least 100 people. Whenever you die and are not returned to life within 24 hours by other means, as long as the settlement still exists and there are no other claims on your soul (such as a contract with a devil) and nothing trapping your soul (such as being slain by a soul eater), your attuned apparition magically transports your soul, remains, and all of the items you had worn or carried at the time of your death back to the chosen settlement, where you are reborn. The nature of this rebirth varies between animists; some magically reinvigorate their physical forms to return to life in their original bodies, while others pass their knowledge and power on to a new inheritor who effectively takes their place in the grand story of existence. Regardless of the exact nature of your rebirth, you or your inheritor are fully restored with your level, experience, and equipment intact one week after your death. If you choose an inheritor and their ancestry is different than yours, your attribute modifiers don't change, but you can freely retrain your ancestry feats and any other feats that relied on them as prerequisites as part of your rebirth.</p>\n<p>There is no limit to the number of times you can be reborn, but if you die before a week has passed since your last rebirth, neither you nor your attuned apparitions have recovered enough energy to complete the process again, and your soul passes to whatever final reward it has earned.</p>"
