Select any one common @Compendium[pf2e.journals.EEZvDB1Z7ezwaxIr]{Domain}â€”a subject of particular interest or importance to you. You gain the initial domain spell for that domain.</p>\n<p>Domain spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to draw energy from your inexhaustible divine spark and convert it into mortal spellcasting energy.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat multiple times, selecting a different domain each time and gaining its domain spell.</p>"
