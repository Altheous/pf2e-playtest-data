Attempt a Diplomacy check to Request or an Intimidation check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.2u915NdUyQan6uKF]{Demoralize} against one weapon within 60 feet—even though most weapons are inanimate and mindless, your words somehow still can affect it as if it were living and you shared a language. The DC for this check is the Will DC of the creature wielding the weapon or a moderate DC for the weapon's level. The object is then temporarily immune to Extract Vow of Nonviolence for one day.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The object swears not to hurt you. You gain resistance to all damage dealt by that specific weapon for 10 minutes as the weapon attempts to mitigate harm to you. The resistance is equal to half your level.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but each time the weapon damages you, the duration of the effect decreases by 1 minute.</p>\n<p>When you gain this feat, choose cold iron, darkwood, dawnsilver, or silver. For some reason—perhaps because you underestimate this material, or because you think it a friend— you are forever unable to use Extract Vow of Nonviolence on objects composed of the chosen material.</p>"
