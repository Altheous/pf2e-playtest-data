Signal all squadmates affected by your commander's banner; you and each ally can Step directly toward a hostile creature they are observing as a free action. Any hostile creatures within 10 feet of you or a squadmate after this movement must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classDC.value)|traits:emotion,fear,mental] save against your class DC; on a failure they become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} for 1 round and on a critical failure they become fleeing for 1 round and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2}.
