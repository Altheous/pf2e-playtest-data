You restore [[/r 80]]{80 Hit Points} to yourself and each squadmate affected by your commander's banner; this effect has the healing trait. If an affected ally was @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} due to their Hit Points being reduced to 0, they can immediately Stand and pick up any dropped weapons. Then each affected ally can Stride up to twice their Speed directly towards an enemy they are observing; if they end this movement with an enemy within their reach, they can attempt to Strike that enemy as a reaction. You and your squadmates can use Valkyrie's Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.</p>"
