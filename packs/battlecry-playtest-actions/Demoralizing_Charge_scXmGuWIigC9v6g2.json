If they end this movement adjacent to an enemy, they can attempt to Strike that enemy as a reaction. For each of these Strikes that are successful, the target enemy must succeed at a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classDC.value)|trait:demoralizing-charge] save against your class DC or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 1} (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2} on a critical failure).
