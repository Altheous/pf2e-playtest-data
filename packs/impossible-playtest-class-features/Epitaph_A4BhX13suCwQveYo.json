You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using necromancer spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the Mortem Ultimatum necromancer feat to gain a second slot.</p>"
