Whenever you cast a spell or use an ability that would deal void or vitality damage, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to void or to vitality. For instance, if the creature were immune to void and had no resistance or immunity to vitality damage, it would take vitality damage from the spell or ability. Resistance or immunity to both (or to all damage) applies as normal.</p>"
